# Demonstration
#This is the first demonstation to use of version control system "Git".
Version control software allows you to have “versions” of a project, which show the changes that were made to the code over time, and allows you to backtrack if necessary and undo those changes. 
This ability alone of being able to compare two versions or reverse changes, makes it fairly invaluable when working on larger projects.

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
